# i3 tiling window manager
I use **Arch Linux** and the **i3 tiling window manager** as my primary driver. i3 is the only desktop (wm) that doesn't get in the way - we just click!.
My desktop (wm) has a Nordic, clean, and somewhat minimalistic look and feel. The applications I use have been chosen mostly from Gnome and KDE.
I don't need a minimalistic 'light' setup as my machines have more than enough RAM (PC - 16GB RAM, laptop - 32GB RAM).

I prefer a clean and somewhat minimalist desktop

## About
I've created this repo primarily as a backup of my installation instructions and configuration files, and also to give back to the i3 community to help others setup their systems.
