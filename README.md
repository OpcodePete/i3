# i3 tiling window manager

## My i3
My primary driver is **Arch Linux** with **i3** on my desktop.

i3 is the only desktop (wm) that does not get in the way. Using other tiling window mangers was not intuitive for me, but using i3, well... it just clicked!

My **i3** setup uses a Nordic theme, with a clean and minimalistic look and feel.

The applications I use were chosen primarily from the Gnome and KDE desktop environments. My development machines have sufficent memory (PC:16GB RAM, laptop:32GB RAM) therefore I do not feel the need to go 'light'. I have chosen in my opinion the 'best' apps that can get the job done - don't judge bro ;)

## About
This repo was created as a backup for my installation guide and configuration files. By sharing this I hope to give back to the i3 community - helping others with their setups and configurations.

## Setup
I use three monitors and have specific workspaces assigned to each of the monitors. Also I use _i3 Layouts_ to set placeholder windows for specific applications to reside in.

When i3 starts, workspaces appear at their set monitors, and (my most used) applications auto-launch into their set workspaces. I'm ready to work!
